# calhacks_2019-Quiz_Friend
user generated quiz bot using google cloud speech to text and text to speech API!

Quiz Friend is an interactive flashcard app created by 4 student participators at calhacks 2019!
We wanted to create this app in order to help students study. The twist to this flashcard app is that questions
are read out loud to the user, made possible by Google Cloud API, and the user is able to answer the question
verbally, also made possible by Google Cloud API.

We used Python, Tkinter, Google Cloud API(text to speech, speech to text) as our technologies.
